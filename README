Overview
========

This repository is for experimental code related to various Natural Language
Processing options.  We hope to provide some examples for each other and 
make this a bit of a playground to toss out prototypes and proof of concept
code to assess it's relevancy for projects here at the library.

Git Flow
========

As with our other projects plesae use the branching structure best practices
agreed on and enforced with Git Flow.

Playspace
=========

Since this is all mostly prototype code right now please put any personal code
you're playing around with in

::  EULnlp/playspace/<yourname>

Where <yourname> is ... well, you get it.
